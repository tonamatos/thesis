\section{Amoeba trees}\label{sec:amoeba_trees}

I present the properties of amoeba trees and recent advancements regarding their conjectures.

My Contribution: I independently conceptualized several key properties discussed in this section.
Additionally, I authored abstractions and object-oriented frameworks that had a significant impact on the results presented in \cite{GomezetalPreprint}.
Apart from my immediate contributions, I focus on unpublished ideas that helped shaped the research.
