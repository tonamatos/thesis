\section{Connections to learning theory}\label{sec:learning_theory}

I formalize the connection between deep computations and learning theory.
Here I include a series of examples connecting different variants of the NIP.
A good explanation or analogy would be great in this section.
Expanding on the initial concepts from \cite{Duenezetal2026}, I explicitly map the relationships between the Non-Independence Property (NIP), VC-dimension, and PAC-learnability within this new context.
