\chapter{Group Actions on Graphs}\label{ch:group_actions}

This is the group actions on graphs chapter of the thesis.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro_group_actions}

\section{Border tracing in arbitrary adjacency graphs}\label{sec:border_tracing}

While border tracing is standard for finite planar graphs, I generalize these algorithms to arbitrary adjacency graphs.

My Contribution: I developed and analyzed two generalized algorithms for this setting.

\section{Recursive constructions}\label{sec:recursive_constructions}

I summarize my contributions to both \cite{Eslavaetal2025} and \cite{Caroetal2023} regarding recursive constructions of graphs with interesting combinatorial properties.

\section{Amoeba trees}\label{sec:amoeba_trees}

I present the properties of amoeba trees and recent advancements regarding their conjectures.

My Contribution: I independently conceptualized several key properties discussed in this section.
Additionally, I authored abstractions and object-oriented frameworks that had a significant impact on the results presented in \cite{GomezetalPreprint}.

\section{Infinitary amoeba graphs}\label{sec:infinitary_amoeba_graphs}

I synthesize ideas on infinite graphs, focusing on the interaction between automorphism groups, ends, and amenable groups, specifically placing my own results and ideas concerning amoeba graphs within this broader theoretical context.
